"""Display-only short title for tasks whose title is a whole sentence.

Tasks filed through the grill already get a refined title
(``intake/grill.py``); tasks from ``nh task add``, trackers and the MCP bridge
carry the raw first sentence. This never mutates the stored title — tracker
dedupe keys on it (``web/src/App.jsx`` "dedupe keys" comment).

A title whose (quote-stripped) length is already at or under ``limit`` is
returned as-is, colon and all — the separator cut only fires when the title
would otherwise overflow the limit.
