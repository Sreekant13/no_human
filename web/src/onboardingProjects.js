// The projects step of the first-run wizard: how a project definition binds
// repos, which of them is the default, and what the wizard refuses to do with a
// definition that binds none.
//
// BUG (first external DMG tester): finished onboarding, landed on a board
// reading "Projects 0 / Repos 1". The wizard's own launch summary had said
// "Projects 1" one screen earlier.
//
// Root cause, and it is upstream of the skip: `addProject()` built every new
// definition as `{ name, repos: new Set() }` — EMPTY by construction. Binding a
// repo was a separate act (ticking a checkbox in the card), so the obvious
// sequence "type a name → + Add project → Continue" produced a definition with
// no repos every time. `finish()` then read `if (repoPaths.length > 0)` and
// dropped it with no request, no error and no message, while the summary step
// went on counting `projectDefs.length`. Two independent halves of the same
// defect: a default that is wrong, and a silent discard that hides it.
//
// Both are fixed here rather than in the JSX:
//   * `newProjectDef` seeds the definition with the repos the user just
//     onboarded — visibly, as ticked checkboxes they can untick — instead of
//     with nothing.
//   * `unboundProjects` names any definition that still binds nothing, so the
//     wizard can refuse out loud instead of discarding in silence.
//
// A second tester request lives here too: "one repo should be the default but
// configurable". The default repo of a project is its `primary_repo` — the
// column exists, TaskComposer already reads it, and POST /api/projects already
// accepts it, but onboarding never sent one, so the server fell back to
// repo_paths[0]: whichever checkbox happened to be ticked first. `primary` is
// now a tracked, choosable part of the definition and `projectPayload` sends it.
