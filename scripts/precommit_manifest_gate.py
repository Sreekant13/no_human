"""Pre-commit gate: block a commit that changes a pinned file without re-pinning.

The recurring defect this catches
---------------------------------
`RELEASE_MANIFEST.txt` pins every shipped file's content with a SHA-256, and it
is at once the release inventory AND the approval ledger `build_public_export.py`
gates on (see `scripts/check_release_manifest.py`). The defect that keeps landing
a red main and tripping the export gate is a *split commit*: a shipped file's
bytes change but its manifest row is left on the old hash — the two halves of one
change committed apart. CI's `inventory` job catches it, but only on the public
tree at push time; by then main is already red.

This gate moves that same check to commit time, in the source repo, scoped to
exactly the hazard: it looks only at files that are ALREADY pinned and STAGED,
and compares the sha256 of each one's *staged* content against the pin in the
*staged* manifest. So:

  * change a pinned file and forget to re-pin it (or forget to `git add` the
    re-pinned manifest)  -> BLOCKED, with the file(s) named and the fix printed;
  * change a pinned file and stage the updated manifest row in the same commit
    -> PASSES (the staged manifest already carries the new hash);
  * touch only unpinned or brand-new files                       -> PASSES;
  * a commit that stages nothing pinned                          -> PASSES.

It is deliberately narrow. New shipped files with no pin yet, deletions, and the
manifest's own completeness are NOT this gate's job — `check_release_manifest.py
--strict` on the release tree owns those. This gate owns one thing: a pinned
file's staged bytes must match its staged pin.

It reads the git INDEX, not the working tree, because a commit records the index.
`git cat-file blob :<path>` yields the staged content of a file (for a symlink,
the blob is its target string, so hashing it matches the manifest's own symlink
convention). The manifest is read the same way (`:RELEASE_MANIFEST.txt`), so a
row re-pinned and staged in this very commit is what the comparison sees.

Reuses `parse_manifest` from `check_release_manifest.py` rather than a second
copy of the manifest grammar. Standard library + `git` only, so it runs without
the project venv. Exit 0 when clean (or nothing to check), 1 when a pinned file's
staged bytes diverge from its staged pin.
